- budget planung implementieren

Focus more on single factions (avoid getting reputation always from the start)

Create a measurement for how expensive it is to get to an augmentation:
- time based?
-- time to get into faction (depend on requirements)
-- time to reach required reputation (depends on work type)
-- multiple augmentations from one faction are cheaper than from different factions
-- how to handle faction donations?

Favor hacking levels improving augmentations over combat stats
- add AugmentationStats to database
-- wanted: hacking_exp_mult, hacking_mult, faction_rep_mult, hacking_speed_mult, company_rep_mult


Algo:
 while money to spend
   find cheapest wanted augmentation
      nothing found?
         find cheapest augmentation
      nothing found?
	 give up
   update reputation with corresponding faction
